# nanotars catch-up backlog

Outstanding items from the upstream catch-up. See `docs/upstream-triage-2026-04-25.md` for the full 154-row verdict matrix and rationale; this doc only tracks what is **not yet shipped**.

Markers:
- `[ ]` outstanding, not started
- `[~]` partially shipped (scaffolded, needs finishing)
- `[?]` unverified — needs a code check before being acted on
- `[x]` done (kept here briefly so the previous turn's "outstanding" list can be reconciled)

When an item lands, strike it through or delete the line. The triage doc keeps the durable record.

---

## Phase 1 — trivial wins

All Phase 1 items shipped. See the Reconciliation section at the bottom of this doc for callsites and verification dates.

## Phase 2 — medium architecture-preserving

**Cluster B — compose pipeline**
- [~] Three-tier container skills — shared `container/skills/` + per-group `groups/<folder>/skills/` + selection list in `container.json`. Shared tier exists (`container/skills/agent-browser`, `container/skills/self-customize`); per-group tier and selection mechanism not yet present.

**Cluster C — channels & media**
- [ ] Telegram typed-media routing (`sendPhoto` / `sendVideo` / `sendAudio` extension-dispatch) — closes the `sendFile` gap. Not present in `plugins/channels/telegram/index.js`.
- [ ] CLI always-on local-socket channel (Area 4, ADOPT medium).

(Cluster A items reassigned: chat_sdk_* KV adapter → Phase 6+7, per-provider session_state → Phase 5D. Cluster E secret-redact body parity verified — see Reconciliation.)

## Phase 4 — multi-user RBAC + entity model

Migrations 008-018 are in (`agent_groups`, `messaging_groups`, `messaging_group_agents`, `users`, `user_roles`, `agent_group_members`, `user_dms`, `pending_approvals`, `pending_sender_approvals`, `pending_channel_approvals`, `pending_questions`). Approval primitive (`pickApprover`, `registerApprovalHandler`) and `pending-questions` accessors are in. The remaining work is finish-and-verify, not new design.

- [x] 4A — sender-resolver + access-gate hooks wired through router/orchestrator. Verified in slice 4 audit (`docs/phase-4-5-audit-2026-04-27.md` §1) — `resolveSender` callsites at `src/orchestrator.ts:502, 843, 869` plus `sender_scope='known'` gate at lines 504-509 / 871-876.
- [x] 4B — `command-gate.ts` host-side command gate against `user_roles`. Verified slice 4 audit §2 — `src/command-gate.ts` exists; `checkCommandPermission` callsite chain at `src/ipc/auth.ts:58, 66` plus per-handler defensive re-checks. (The earlier "not yet found" note was stale.)
- [x] 4C — card-expiry timer + sweep coverage. Verified slice 4 audit §3 — `startApprovalExpiryPoll()` at `src/index.ts:139` + `sweepExpiredApprovals()` at `src/permissions/approval-expiry.ts:33-49`. Sender/channel coverage is via the unified-approval architecture (paired `pending_approvals` row).
- [x] 4C — OneCLI manual-approval bridge port. Verified slice 4 audit §4 — `src/permissions/onecli-bridge.ts` invoked at `src/index.ts:169` (`startOneCLIBridge()`) / `src/index.ts:261` (`stopOneCLIBridge()`).
- [x] 4D — `pending_sender_approvals` / `pending_channel_approvals` request/respond flows. Verified slice 4 audit §5 — `requestSenderApproval` invoked at `src/orchestrator.ts:518, 883`; `requestChannelApproval` at `src/orchestrator.ts:844`. Tests at `src/permissions/__tests__/{sender,channel}-approval.test.ts`.

## Phase 5 — capability bolt-ons

Migrations + scaffolding are in: `install_packages` and `add_mcp_server` MCP tools, host-side validation/approval queueing, `applyDecision` handlers, `notifyAgent`, lifecycle pause/resume (`emergency_stop` + `resume_processing` in `src/lifecycle-handlers.ts`), per-agent-group image build (`src/image-build.ts`), `create_agent` permissions stub (`src/permissions/create-agent.ts`), AgentProvider seam (`container/agent-runner/src/providers/`).

- [x] 5A — self-mod end-to-end. Verified slice 4 audit §6 — full flow asserted by `src/__tests__/self-mod-flow.test.ts` (Phase 5C-06 test): pending_approvals row, applyDecision mutates container_config + buildImage + restartGroup + notifyAfter + agent system message, denial path, invalid-input path.
- [x] 5B — `image-build.ts` invoked from install_packages live path. Verified slice 4 audit §7 — `buildAgentGroupImage` injected as the `buildImage` dep at `src/index.ts:151`.
- [x] 5C — `create_agent` MCP tool registered + wired. Verified slice 4 audit §8 — admin-gated tool registration at `container/agent-runner/src/ipc-mcp-stdio.ts:663-684`; host-side handler at `src/permissions/create-agent.ts` with re-validation + filesystem scaffold + member registration.
- [ ] 5D provider plugins — Codex / OpenCode / Ollama as plugins (not skill-branches). Provider seam is in (`container/agent-runner/src/providers/`); plugin-loader recognises `agentProvider: true` manifests (`src/plugin-loader.ts:440-462`); resolution reads `NANOCLAW_AGENT_PROVIDER` env var with `'claude'` fallback. No second real provider plugin shipped yet.
- [ ] 5D dependency — per-provider `session_state` continuation namespacing. v1's `sessions` table is `(group_folder PK, session_id)` — one continuation per group, not keyed by provider. Once a second provider lands under 5D, switching `NANOCLAW_AGENT_PROVIDER` for a group would feed a Claude session-id to the new provider's SDK and either reject or replay nothing. Re-key as `(group_folder, provider, session_id)` and update `setSession` / lookup paths in `src/orchestrator.ts` as part of the same slice that ships the second provider — designing the namespace shape blindly without a real consumer risks getting it wrong.

## Phase 6 + 7 — architectural foundation (OPTIONAL)

Per the triage doc, this is the only fully-optional block. Per-session containers + two-DB IPC + heartbeat sweep + Phase-6-enabled bolt-ons (cross-container agent messaging, supportsThreads, subscribe, admin-transport, per-provider session_state).

- [ ] Decision needed: commit to Phase 6 or formally close it as "skipped under technical-merit lens." If skipped, Phase 7 items roll into "won't fix" since they require Phase 6 to land.
- [ ] `chat_sdk_*` SqliteStateAdapter (KV + TTL + lock primitive) — defer until Phase 6 commits or until a real consumer surfaces. v2's `src/state-sqlite.ts` is the reference (~120 LOC, three tables: `chat_sdk_kv`, `chat_sdk_subscriptions`, `chat_sdk_locks`). v2's only consumer is `chat-sdk-bridge.ts` which is on the SKIP-ALT list (vendor lock-in to `@chat-adapter/*`). v1 has no current consumer; `pending-codes.json`'s file-with-mutex works fine for single-process. Phase 6's per-session two-DB IPC creates the natural consumer (per-session locks, KV with TTL for pending state). Pull this in alongside the Phase 6 commit if/when that block is taken.

## Plugin & marketplace ecosystem

nanotars's plugin model lives across two repos: this fork (`TerrifiedBug/nanotars`) ships only core + a few baseline skills; everything else (channels, integrations) lives in the marketplace at `TerrifiedBug/nanotars-skills` and is installed via the Claude Code plugin marketplace. Catch-up work that touches the entity-model schema, the channel plugin interface, or the plugin boundary rules has marketplace-side consequences that the triage doc didn't track.

**Marketplace schema-staleness sweep (mirrors the local skills sweep):**

Inventory done 2026-04-27: only 5 channel-plugin installer skills have raw SQL touching `registered_groups` (discord, slack, telegram, webhook, whatsapp). Container skills and non-channel plugin installers don't touch the DB at all. Total: 10 stale refs, much smaller than initially feared.

- [~] Patch the 5 channel-plugin SKILL.md files to use entity-model SQL — PR open as `TerrifiedBug/nanotars-skills#11` (2026-04-27). Flip to `[x]` once merged.
- [x] **Decision: dropped the `compatibleNanotarsVersion` / CI-bot ideas.** Versioning infrastructure is over-engineered for a single-user installation, and the breakage was a one-time hit from the entity-model migration rather than a recurring drift problem. The right fix is enforcing the plugin boundary so skills don't reach into core schema in the first place — see the new "Skills MUST NOT query the SQLite database directly" rule in `CLAUDE.md` (added 2026-04-27).

**Deferred — `nanotars` CLI subcommands abstracting operator DB ops** (e.g. `nanotars groups list/view/status/update`, `nanotars debug groups`):

Would let core skills become 1-line CLI wrappers instead of inlining SQL, surviving any future schema migration without skill-side changes. Estimated 2-3 days to build (subcommand surface design + Node entry points + skill rewrites). Deferred until either (a) a future architecture change actually causes pain again, or (b) the in-container skill-creation flow needs a stable read API for agents in the container. The CLAUDE.md boundary rule + slice 3a/b sweep is the cheap fix that closes the current breakage; this CLI is the durable-but-not-yet-justified follow-up.

**In-container skill-creation flow correctness:**
- [ ] When a user in a Telegram chat asks TARS to build a skill, in-container TARS has no `/create-skill-plugin` skill and no formal plugin-boundary rulebook — those are host-side artifacts (`.claude/skills/create-skill-plugin/`, `.claude/skills/nanotars-publish-skill/`, the `Plugin Boundary` section of `CLAUDE.md`). Build a container-side equivalent so in-chat skill creation produces marketplace-compliant output instead of improvising from filesystem inspection.
- [ ] Decide on the artifact: (a) a bundled `container/skills/create-skill-plugin/` that mirrors the host skill, (b) a `groups/global/IDENTITY.md` snippet that points TARS at the host skill via a request-handoff, or (c) a structured rule doc (e.g. `container/skills/plugin-rules.md`) that defines the boundary inline so any agent can follow it without a skill invocation. Recommendation: (c) for the rules + (a) for the guided flow.
- [ ] End-to-end test: from a Telegram message ("TARS, make me a skill that does X") through to a PR opened on `TerrifiedBug/nanotars-skills`. Validates that in-container TARS knows to invoke the right skill, generates to `.claude/skills/add-skill-*/`, uses `Dockerfile.partial` (never core `Dockerfile`), and either invokes a publish primitive itself or surfaces a clear "ready to publish — run `/nanotars-publish-skill` on the host" handoff.
- [ ] In-container `gh` availability + auth surface for the publish step. If TARS is meant to open PRs autonomously from the container, the `gh` CLI needs to be present and authenticated with marketplace-PR permissions. If publishing stays a host-only step, the container path needs to stop short cleanly with a handoff message.
- [ ] Periodic accuracy re-check of host `create-skill-plugin` and `nanotars-publish-skill` SKILLs against the live plugin model. Both verified accurate 2026-04-27 (last touched 2026-04-26 in `0fe1962`), but they drift whenever the plugin interface evolves (new `plugin.json` fields, new container-skill mount paths, new marketplace layout). Wire this re-check into the catch-up workflow: any commit touching `src/plugin-loader.ts`, `src/plugin-types.ts`, `src/container-mounts.ts`, or marketplace conventions should trigger a manual review of these two SKILLs.

## Native `/commands` feature (Hermes parity)

Currently `src/command-gate.ts` has a hardcoded admin-only command Set (`/grant`, `/revoke`, `/list-users`, `/list-roles`, `/register-group`, `/delete-group`, `/restart`, `/pause`, `/resume`, `/rebuild-image`, `/pair-telegram`). Each command has its own bespoke handler module (`src/lifecycle-admin-commands.ts`, `src/pair-admin-command.ts`, `src/rebuild-image-admin-command.ts`). Non-admin commands have no formal dispatcher — they fall through to the agent which interprets raw text. There is no plugin-extensible command registration. Goal: a Hermes-style generic command framework.

- [ ] Centralised host-side command dispatcher — extract the per-command handler dispatch from the bespoke modules into a single registry keyed by command name. Each entry: `{ name, adminOnly, handler, helpText, argSpec? }`.
- [ ] Plugin-extensible registration — extend `ChannelPluginConfig` (or add a top-level `plugin.commands` field) so plugins can register their own commands with the dispatcher. Reuses the existing `command-gate.ts` admin/non-admin gating.
- [ ] Built-in `/help` — auto-generated from registered commands' `helpText`. Replaces ad-hoc help-string improvisation by the agent.
- [ ] Telegram-side native UI — call BotFather's `setMyCommands` API on plugin load so commands appear in the Telegram client's `/` autocomplete menu. Per-chat-scope override available for admin-only commands.
- [ ] Argument parsing primitive — minimal `argSpec` (positional + named) so commands like `/foo bar=baz` get pre-parsed before reaching the handler. Avoid pulling in a full CLI parser; aim for ~50 LOC.
- [ ] Cross-channel parity — same registration model works on whatever non-Telegram channels are installed (Discord, Slack, etc.). Each channel plugin maps its native command surface (slash-commands, reactions, mentions) to the dispatcher's expectations.
- [ ] Migration of the existing 11 admin commands onto the new dispatcher — mechanical port; do this as the second-to-last step so the new dispatcher gets exercised before the old paths are torn out.
- [ ] Decision needed: should agents be able to register commands too (e.g. an in-container agent declares "I respond to `/myskill`")? Probably yes for skill plugins, but the security implication (agent registers `/grant` and shadows the admin command) needs `command-gate.ts` to enforce a reserved-name list.

## Side debt — schema-stale skills sweep (local)

Skills queried the dropped `registered_groups` schema (migration 009). 7 skills affected, 22 stale references total. All shipped 2026-04-27 in slices 3a-1 (canonical) and 3a-2 (the other six) — see entries below for landing slice + commit SHA:

- [x] `.claude/skills/nanotars-groups/SKILL.md` — 4 refs, 104 lines. Rewrite first as the canonical template for the others. — Done 2026-04-27 (slice 3a-1, canonical template).
- [x] `.claude/skills/nanotars-add-agent/SKILL.md` — 1 ref, 248 lines. — Done 2026-04-27 (slice 3a-2, commit cdd99a7).
- [x] `.claude/skills/nanotars-add-group/SKILL.md` — 7 refs, 282 lines. — Done 2026-04-27 (slice 3a-2, commit c68e93c).
- [x] `.claude/skills/nanotars-debug/SKILL.md` — 2 refs, 528 lines. — Done 2026-04-27 (slice 3a-2, commit 083068a).
- [x] `.claude/skills/nanotars-remove-plugin/SKILL.md` — 2 refs, 147 lines. — Done 2026-04-27 (slice 3a-2, commit ba262fd).
- [x] `.claude/skills/create-channel-plugin/SKILL.md` — 3 refs, 585 lines. — Done 2026-04-27 (slice 3a-2, commit e3d91f2).
- [x] `.claude/skills/nanotars-setup/SKILL.md` — 6 refs, 857 lines. — Done 2026-04-27 (slice 3a-2, commit 5a29862).

Each should switch to the three-table join (`agent_groups` ⋈ `messaging_group_agents` ⋈ `messaging_groups`) and target modern wiring fields (`engage_mode` / `engage_pattern` / `sender_scope` / `ignored_message_policy`) instead of `requires_trigger`.

(See "Plugin & marketplace ecosystem" above for the marketplace-side mirror of this sweep.)

## Comprehensive skill audit — every skill, every kind of staleness

Broader than the schema-stale sweep above. The schema sweep targets one known issue (`registered_groups` references); this audit catches everything else: outdated CLI commands, removed env vars, branding drift (`nanoclaw` vs `nanotars`), obsolete file paths, dropped MCP tools, wrong plugin manifest fields, references to skills/commands that no longer exist, incorrect trigger keywords, old onboarding flows, deprecated container mount paths, etc.

Run this AFTER the schema-stale sweep lands so the entity-model rewrites don't get re-audited.

**Scope:**
- Every `.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md` in this repo (~18 bundled skills today, count + names verified at audit time).
- Every `plugins/*/skills/**/SKILL.md` and `plugins/*/files/container-skills/SKILL.md` in `TerrifiedBug/nanotars-skills` (~25-30 marketplace plugins).

**Per-skill audit checklist:**
- [ ] Does the skill reference any dropped database tables or columns? (Beyond `registered_groups` — also check for old column names, removed migration artefacts.)
- [ ] Are referenced CLI commands still valid? (`nanotars` wrapper subcommands, slash-commands like `/pair-telegram`, `/pause`, `/grant`.)
- [ ] Are env var names still current? (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `CLAUDE_MODEL`, `NANOCLAW_AGENT_PROVIDER` — especially anything renamed `NANOCLAW_*` ↔ `NANOTARS_*`.)
- [ ] Is the branding consistent? (No `nanoclaw` references in user-facing prose where `nanotars` is the user-visible name.)
- [ ] Are file paths still valid? (`store/messages.db`, `plugins/`, `groups/`, `data/`, `~/.claude/`, container-side `/workspace/...`.)
- [ ] Are referenced MCP tools still registered? (`install_packages`, `add_mcp_server`, `ask_question`, `create_agent` — confirm each is in `container/agent-runner/src/mcp-tools/`.)
- [ ] Does the skill reference other skills correctly? (Slash-command names match installed skills; no references to removed skills like the dropped slack-formatting variant.)
- [ ] Are `plugin.json` schema fields current? (`channels`, `groups`, `containerEnvVars`, `containerHooks`, `containerMounts`, `publicEnvVars`, `dockerfilePartials`, `dependencies`, `agentProvider`/`providerName` — match `src/plugin-types.ts`.)
- [ ] Are trigger keywords / `description` triggers in the YAML frontmatter accurate against current usage?
- [ ] Does the skill assume an old onboarding flow? (Now `setup.sh` + `nanotars` wrapper + `data/onboarding.json`.)

**Output:** per-skill verdict (clean / minor-fix / rewrite-needed), captured as a tracker doc (suggested location: `docs/skill-audit-2026-MM-DD.md`). The audit doc is the input to fix-PRs landed across both repos.

- [ ] Run the audit (probably ~1-2d depending on skill count and whether subagents per-skill or one batched).
- [ ] Land fixes in waves grouped by issue class (one PR per issue class is easier to review than per-skill).
- [ ] Wire a CI check into `nanotars-skills` after the first audit so future PRs flag the same staleness classes automatically (compatible with the `compatibleNanotarsVersion` decision in the marketplace section).

## CONTRIBUTE upstream — opt-in goodwill PRs

These are nanotars wins missing in v2. Pure upside for upstream; no effect on this fork.

- [ ] Container hardening flags PR (`--cap-drop=ALL`, `--cap-add=SYS_PTRACE`, `--security-opt=no-new-privileges`, custom seccomp, `--cpus=2`, `--memory=4g`, `--pids-limit=256`). Single-block PR — biggest concrete security delta in the triage.
- [ ] `AUTH_ERROR_PATTERNS` + `isAuthError` PR (`src/router.ts:7`).
- [ ] `MAX_CONCURRENT_CONTAINERS` host-wide cap PR — v2 still exports the constant but never reads it; ~30 LOC semaphore-around-`wakeContainer`.
- [ ] Mount allowlist tests PR (`src/__tests__/mount-security.test.ts` portable; v2 ships zero tests for security-critical code).
- [ ] ffmpeg thumbnail extraction for inbound video/GIF PR (Area 4 UX win).
- [ ] `isValidGroupFolder` defense-in-depth on read path PR (Area 1).
- [ ] `context_mode` ('group' | 'isolated') on `scheduled_tasks` PR.
- [ ] Online backup hook (`db.backup` keep-2 retention) PR.
- [ ] `task_run_logs` table + recent-runs view PR.

## Reconciliation — items reported "outstanding" 2026-04-27 that turned out to be shipped

(Kept here briefly so memory observation 9286-9315 reconcile cleanly. Delete after first read.)

- [x] Mount allowlist colon-injection check — `src/mount-security.ts:213`.
- [x] `splitForLimit` + tests — `src/channel-helpers.ts:11`, `src/__tests__/channel-helpers.test.ts`.
- [x] `transformOutboundText` / `extractReplyContext` / `NetworkError` retry / `openDM` — all in `src/types.ts` + `src/router.ts` + `src/plugin-loader.ts` + `src/permissions/user-dms.ts`.
- [x] `unregistered_senders` table — `src/db/init.ts:272`.

- [x] `hasTable` helper — `src/db/init.ts:304`.
- [x] Numbered migration framework with `schema_version.name` — `src/db/init.ts:609-680` (18 migrations applied).
- [x] Pinned `CLAUDE_CODE_VERSION` ARGs + `tini` PID 1 + `minimumReleaseAge=4320` — all in `container/Dockerfile` and `container/agent-runner/.npmrc`.

- [x] `context_mode` on scheduled_tasks + online backup hook + `task_run_logs` table — `src/db/init.ts`.
- [x] `secret-redact` module — `src/secret-redact.ts` (parity with v2's body still flagged `[?]` above).
- [x] `claude-md-compose.ts` + `CLAUDE.local.md` — `src/claude-md-compose.ts`.
- [x] Vitest + GH Actions CI — `vitest.config.ts`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.
- [x] Four-axis engage model — `src/db/init.ts:40-43` + migration `007_add_engage_mode_axes`.
- [x] Label-scoped orphan cleanup — `src/container-runtime.ts:93,117` uses `--filter label=...`.
- [x] Pre-task `script` hook on scheduled_tasks — migration `006_add_task_script`.
- [x] Router refactor onto (messaging_group, agent_group) — `src/orchestrator.ts:194-340`.

- [x] Per-agent-group image build — `src/image-build.ts`.
- [x] AgentProvider seam — `container/agent-runner/src/providers/factory.ts`.
- [x] OneCLI gateway — Cluster F shipped 2026-04-25; latest commit walks back the user-facing surface ("Option A: de-emphasize OneCLI").
- [x] `dockerfilePartials` path-traversal guard — `src/image-build.ts:43-49` (TypeScript path) + `container/build.sh:24-34` (shared base build path). Both code paths that resolve+read partials guard with `path.relative` (TS) or `readlink -f` + case-pattern (bash). Verified 2026-04-27.
- [x] `READ_TOOLS_RE` expansion — `container/agent-runner/src/security-hooks.ts:62` regex includes every tool from the triage list (`more`, `od`, `hexdump`, `bun`, `awk`, `sed`, `python3`) plus `cat`, `less`, `head`, `tail`, `base64`, `xxd`, `strings`, `python`, `node`, `perl`, `ruby`. Tests at `security-hooks.test.ts:72,86` cover `hexdump` and `bun`. Verified 2026-04-27.
- [x] `shellQuote` unit tests — extracted into `src/container-mounts.ts` as `shellQuote(value)`; tests in `src/__tests__/shell-quote.test.ts` (5 cases). Slice 1 work, 2026-04-27.
- [x] `secret-redact` body parity with v2 — verified 2026-04-27. v1 (`src/secret-redact.ts`, 170 lines) and v2 (`src/modules/secret-redaction/index.ts`, 171 lines) are functionally identical. Required behaviors all present in v1: length-sort + `Set` dedup at line 99, injectable paths via `LoadSecretsOptions.projectRoot` / `credentialsPath`, `ONECLI_API_KEY` in `NEVER_EXEMPT` (line 24). v1 is slightly more capable (back-compat array form on `loadSecrets`).
